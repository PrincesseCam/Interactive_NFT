# Developing-Interactive-NFT-in-the-Metaverse
In 2015 Ethereum, created by Vitalik Buterin, made the blockchain programmable. This led to the creation of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), a type of digital asset that represents ownership of unique items or content. Interactive NFT, also called "smart NFT", can have value if it provides a unique and desirable experience or feature. After understanding what is needed to create an interactive NFT and what steps to take, we practice and design it. As an idea for the interactive NFT, we decided to create an environment where users can change the animation of the avatar and rotate it with a mouse.
